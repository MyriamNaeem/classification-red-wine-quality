# Predicting wine quality using machine learning

The dataset describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on it's quality. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).Your task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.

I'm going to have the following approach:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

## 1. Problem Definition

Can I predict the wine quality based on the data?

## 2. Data

Available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset

## 3. Evaluation

* Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
* Build classification models to predict the wine quality.
* Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.

## 4. Features

This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in the data.

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):\
1 - fixed acidity\
2 - volatile acidity\
3 - citric acid\
4 - residual sugar\
5 - chlorides\
6 - free sulfur dioxide\
7 - total sulfur dioxide\
8 - density\
9 - pH\
10 - sulphates\
11 - alcohol\
Output variable (based on sensory data):\
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
